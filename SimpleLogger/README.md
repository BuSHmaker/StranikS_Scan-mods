# SimpleLogger

### Description
Mod records various information about battles, vehicles, players in CSV-files (using the **NetStatisticsModules**). The mod receives information about the player's statistics via the WG-API and also through the XVM-API. To collect information about player online-statistics from XVM-API, activation on the [XVM-website](https://modxvm.com/) is necessary. It is not required to install the XVM-mod itself.
